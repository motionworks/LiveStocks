A dashboard of your favourite stocks updated real-time.

So you need a few modules:
npm install express ejs socket.io underscore.date

The db.json file is basically what we would be getting from http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=show%20tables&env=store://datatables.org/alltableswithkeys

with the following YSQL statement to pull stock quotes for TNB, Nestle, Telekom Malaysia, Maybank & Genting
select * from yahoo.finance.quotes where symbol in ("TNABY.PK","4715.KL","4863.KL","MLYBY.PK","NSLYF.PK")

So we start off by parsing that db.json file however since markets are closed today, we are manually changing the stock prices by calling the following route:
/stock/:name/:price/:change/:close/:open

Sample:
http://192.168.1.103:3000/stock/TELEKOM%20MALAYSIA/3.90/-0.10/4.06/4.00

name: Stock Name
price: Last Traded Realtime Price
change: Change in stock price
close: Closing price
open: Opening price
